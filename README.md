# Etch-a-sketch
A digital recreation of Etch-a-sketch, a tool for sketching coloring and shading simple images. [Live demo](https://rhiannonthompson.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).
## Technologies Used

* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5
* CSS3

## Description
With this game, you can choose to draw in gray-scale or color. I built the game using vanilla JavaScript, pure CSS and HTML. The aim of this project was to put my JavaScript DOM manipulation skills to the test. In building Etch-a-sketch, I practiced implementing DOM methods, such as query selectors and event handlers for controlling user interaction with the DOM.
